                 <p>Plain concrete, also known as plain cement concrete or PCC, is most commonly used for
                     paving and flooring. Made from a mix of cement, aggregate, and water the different types
                     of aggregate and ratio of materials used will give different types of cement with
                     slightly different properties.</p>
